# Instructions for Creating New Slidev Presentations

Always start your reply with "LETS DO THIS!"

All new presentations should be in the presentations folder! This is crucial. Use the Project Setup guidelines.

## 1. Project Setup

1. **Create a deck** (using the project script)
   ```bash
   # Follow the prompts after running:
   npm run create -- "Your Presentation Name"
   # Alternatively, use the interactive menu:
   npm run menu 
   ```
2. **Start the dev-server** (using the project script)
   ```bash
   # Run the specific presentation (replace <name>):
   npm run run -- <presentation-name>
   # Or use the interactive menu:
   npm run menu 
   # This opens http://localhost:3030 with hot-reload
   ```

## 2. Presentation Planning

1. Create a `presentation-plan.txt` in your presentation folder
   - Copy the template from `presentation-plan-template.txt`
   - Fill in all sections of the planning document
   - Use the checkboxes to track your progress

2. Refer to `slide-content-planning.txt` for detailed guidance on:
   - Defining your objective and audience
   - Content organization
   - Visual design strategy
   - Implementation techniques

## 3. File Organization

```
└─ presentations/
   └─ your-presentation-name/
      ├─ presentation-plan.txt  # your planning document
      ├─ slides.md              # main slide file with headmatter
      ├─ slides/                # individual slide files
      │  ├─ 01-intro.md
      │  ├─ 02-problem.md
      │  └─ ...
      └─ assets/                # images, diagrams, etc.
         ├─ images/
         ├─ diagrams/
         └─ code-examples/
```

## 4. Slide Creation Process

1. First set up your global headmatter in `slides.md`:
   ```yaml
   ---
   theme: default       # Choose your theme
   title: My Presentation
   transition: slide-left
   lineNumbers: true
   fonts:
     sans: Montserrat, Roboto
   highlighter: shiki
   ---
   ```

   This is also the first visible Slide in the Presentation so use this as the Opening slide. 

2. Create individual slide files in the `slides/` directory
   - Follow patterns in `slide-creation-guide.txt`
   - Use consistent layouts and styling
   - Keep content concise (5-7 points per slide)

3. Import your slides in the main `slides.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   theme: penguin
   # other global settings
   ---

   ---
   src: ./slides/01-intro.md
   ---

   ---
   src: ./slides/02-problem.md
   ---
   ```

## 5. Testing & Export

1. Test your presentation frequently
   - Use Presenter Mode (press `P`) to check for overflow
   - Test responsiveness by resizing the browser

2. Export your final presentation
   ```bash
   npm run slidev export        # PDF, PowerPoint, images
   npm run slidev build         # Web version (SPA)
   ```
